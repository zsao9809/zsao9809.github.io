#### Language: Simplified Chinese | [English](./README_en.MD) \
This project is a secondary development version of Shoka (considered a spiritual successor), dedicated to improving performance and optimizing the custom modification experience. \
The reason for its creation is that Shoka hasn't been updated for three years, accumulating a large number of bugs and feature requests.

ShokaX's community resource guide and plugin repository can be found at [awesome-shokaX](https://github.com/theme-shoka-x/awesome-shokaX).

## ðŸ’¬ Differences from Shoka
The original Shoka used javascript+Native+nunjucks technology, \
while ShokaX uses typescript+Vue 3+Pug technology. \
Many inaccessible CDN links have been changed.
